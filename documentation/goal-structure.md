# Purpose #
This document should show the goal structure of the end site once built.


# Goals Summary
This application should consume a set of markdown files (file ending `.md`). It should take these
markdown files and create a surfable website. This website can be in anyway customized as long
as it displays the marked information. This is the primary goal of the application. However,
other features may help with the goals of the project.

## File Structure of Consumed
```
./ -- Root Of the Project
./*.md -- Markdown Files
./resources/ -- directory for any files needed to be in the final product
./resources/* a file or directory resource that should be copied over
./* -- Markdown Files can be in subdirectories but they should keep their directory names
```

## File Structure of Output
```
./ -- Root Of the Project
./*.html Pages generated from Markdown Files
./style/*.css Stylesheets generated by cli application
./scripts/*.js Javascript files generated by cli application
./resources/* resource files still attached to root of project
./* -- Any other Markdown Files in other subdirectories shall have names maintained
```

# Pipeline
The project should follow the following steps when running the project. How it does this
will vary by implementation as the project goes along.

1. CLI Interface -- This is how it will interface to the user
2. Parse CLi Arguments -- File Paths Template Choices etc.
3. Make Grunt Calls -- Compile With Marked. Grunt will make this easy on us
4. Inline Compiled HTML into Compile Marked -- This can also be done with IFrames
5. Generate Project Structure -- Also doable with Grunt Tasks
